# Welcome to Advent of Code 
This will be my public repo for the Advent of Code challenges. I will organize each year into their own folder moving forward, and each day will be in its own folder as well. This should help keep everything well organized and easily searchable. 

I am not going for leaderboards for my first year, so I will post solutions as soon as I have them figured out. Please try and not to copy and paste but do the work yourself. That is the best way to learn and I am using a new language each year in order to help learn a new language. 

## About
If you are unfamiliar with Advent of Code, please take a look at this FAQ on the official website: [Advent of Code FAQ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) 

I am closing this one out and archiving.
